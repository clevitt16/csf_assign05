Trisha and Casey wrote the calculator implementation program and server program together.

Trisha worked more on the calculator program. Casey handled the case for 1 token in the operation,
and Trisha handled the cases for 3 and 5 tokens. Trisha also wrote the helper functions isInt, isOp,
performOp, performAssign, and getNumForOp.

Casey worked more on the server program, writing the bulk of the main function in calcServer.cpp
